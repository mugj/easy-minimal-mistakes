Impedance analysis is recognized as one of the principal methods examining fundamental behaviors of electrode materials for supercapacitors. Impedance spectra are obtained at the frequencies of 0.01–100 kHz. As showed in Fig. S5, all the plots of the PANI, EG, and PANI/EGelectrodes display a semicircle at high frequency followed by a transition to linearity at low frequency. The high-frequency intercept of the semicircle with the real axis (RS) gives the 5 internal resistance values of these three-electrode systems for the resistance of the electrolyte solution, the intrinsic resistance of the active material, and the contact resistance at the interface active material/current collector.[S8] All the materials show comparable RS at about 4 Ω. At the high frequency region, large semicircles observed for the PANI electrode is indicative of high interfacial charge-transfer resistance, which can be attributed to the poor electrical conductivity. The EG and PANI/EG10% present relatively smaller semicircle implying the materials possess better the conductivity. The 45°sloped portion of the Nyquist plots is due to the Warburg resistance, resulting from the frequency dependency of ion diffusion/transport in the electrolyte. [S9] The EG and PANI/EG10% electrodes exhibit a negligible Warburg region, which further confirms that they possesses lower ion diffusion resistance. The near-vertical slope at the low frequency region indicates a good capacitor property of the EG and PANI/EG10% electrode materials
